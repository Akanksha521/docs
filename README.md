# Wiki Page for Project Development
## Contribute to Docs
Documentations are in **markdown** format. All changes should be made under `/docs` directory and commmited to `master` branch before deployment. 

## Publish Docs
After commit all changes to `master` branch, run the command
```
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
The `mkdocs` library will take care rest of the work and publish the docs under **Github Pages**. 

You can work it directly from web site.
