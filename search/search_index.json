Then, you have to enable the camera in the raspberry settings by: 'sudo raspi-config' Reboot the pi after that: sudo reboot Give some time for the pi to reboot and log again into it. Finally, test your camera with: raspistill -o image.jpg (it takes a picture and saves it as image.jpg ) After that, a new jpeg file should appear in your directory. Visualizing pictures via ssh If you want to display the images of image files in your computer, make sure to connect to the pi with: ssh -X pi@ pi_adress (focus on the -X ) Install feh if you the don't have it yet: sudo apt-get install feh And finally do: feh image_file .jpg","title":"Using the PiCamera"},{"location":"picamera/#using-the-picamera","text":"For using the PiCamera on a Raspberry Pi, you should, after connecting the camera to the Raspberry, update and upgrade your pi with: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade That may take some short time.
